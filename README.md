This is a project for my school's subject that required using Oracle as Database.
It is a website that i try to replicate the actual library activities, including borrowing books, submiting borrowing tickets,...
There is alot side of this project that still ongoing, but since i have submit this project and receive final grades, I have no motivate to complete it anymore.
Technical speaking, this is a website that use Java as Backend, ReactJS for frontend to handle APIs from Backend. Oracle for Database(obviously); and for Authentication and Authorization, I'm using JWT role-based, but I'm messed up with the role-based part.
Things that is unfinished:
- JWT Role-base.
- Handling Blob and Clob files of Oracle Database.
- Lots of business logics and methods of library unfinished (cause by unthoughtful business analyzing)
I will try to complete these side part of this project on other small repo later.
